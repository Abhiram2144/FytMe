# Frontend Instructions

Place demo clothing images in this folder. The backend will return filenames that should match images here.

Example structure:
```
demo_images/
├── beige_shirt.jpg
├── navy_pants.jpg
├── brown_shoes.jpg
└── ... (more images)
```

Images should be named to match what the backend returns in the outfit recommendations.
